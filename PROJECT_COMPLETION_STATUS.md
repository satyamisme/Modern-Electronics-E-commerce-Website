---

## I. Core Setup & Structure

*   ‚úÖ **Vite Project Setup:** Project initialized with Vite, React, TypeScript.
*   ‚úÖ **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Tailwind CSS is set up and configured (`tailwind.config.js`, `index.css`).
*   ‚úÖ **Basic Directory Structure:** Sensible project structure (`src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/services`, `src/utils`, `src/types`, `src/context`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib`).
*   ‚úÖ **Routing Setup (`App.tsx`):** Main application routing using `react-router-dom` is in place for public and admin sections.
*   ‚úÖ **Context Provider Structure:** `AppContext`, `AuthContext`, `AdminContext` are set up and wrap the application.

## II. Authentication System

*   ‚úÖ **Supabase Client Initialization (`src/lib/supabase.ts`):**
    *   Logic to switch between real and mock Supabase client based on environment variables (`VITE_DEBUG`, credentials availability) is implemented.
    *   Clear console logs indicate which client is active.
*   ‚úÖ **`useSupabase` Hook (`src/hooks/useSupabase.ts`):**
    *   Refactored to interact with the real Supabase auth.
    *   Listens to `onAuthStateChange` to update user and session state.
    *   Provides actual `signUp`, `signIn`, `signOut`, `resetPassword` functions calling `supabase.auth`.
*   ‚úÖ **`AuthService.ts` (`src/services/authService.ts`):**
    *   Refactored to perform Supabase database operations for user profiles (`profiles` table).
    *   Methods for `signUp` (auth + profile creation), `signIn`, `signOut`, `resetPassword`, `updatePassword`.
    *   Methods for `getCurrentAuthUser`, `getCurrentProfile`, `createProfile`, `updateProfile`, `updateUserProfileById` (admin).
    *   Methods for `getUsers` (admin), `updateUserRole` (admin), `deleteUserProfile` (admin - profile only).
    *   Basic role check (`hasRole`, `isAdmin`) and `getUserPermissions` method.
*   ‚úÖ **`AuthContext.tsx` (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):**
    *   Manages auth state (`user`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `error`).
    *   Integrates with `useSupabase` hook and `AuthService` for real authentication and profile fetching (including permissions).
    *   Removed hardcoded demo logins.
    *   Provides `login`, `logout`, `signUp` methods to UI.
*   ‚úÖ **Robust Permission Logic in `AuthContext.hasPermission`:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è `AuthContext.hasPermission` now correctly uses the `state.user.permissions` array, which is populated by `AuthService.getUserPermissions` upon login. Handles exact and wildcard permissions.
*   ‚úÖ **`ProtectedRoute.tsx` (`src/components/admin/ProtectedRoute.tsx`):**
    *   Correctly checks `isAuthenticated` and calls `hasPermission` from `AuthContext`.
*   üî∂ **Admin User Creation Flow:**
    *   ‚úÖ A `UserForm.tsx` component has been created and integrated into `AdminUsers.tsx` to allow for user creation and editing via the UI.
    *   üî≤ **Initial Seeding:** While the UI exists, there's no automated or UI-driven flow to create the *first* super_admin. README updated to instruct manual creation in Supabase. A seeding script could be beneficial.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate (for seeding script):** 0.5 day.

## III. Product Management

*   ‚úÖ **Product & Category Types (`src/types/index.ts`):**
    *   Types updated to be more comprehensive and align with Supabase schema (e.g., `ProductImage` objects).
*   ‚úÖ **`ProductService.ts` (`src/services/productService.ts`):**
    *   Fully refactored to use Supabase for all product, category, and product image CRUD operations.
    *   Removed reliance on mock data (`src/data/products.ts`).
    *   Implemented methods: `getProducts` (with filtering/sorting/pagination, now returns total count), `getProduct` (by ID/slug), `createProduct`, `updateProduct`, `deleteProduct`.
    *   Implemented `getCategories`.
    *   Implemented `searchProducts` (basic ILIKE, notes FTS for production).
    *   Implemented `getFeaturedProducts` and `getBestSellers` (using proxy logic like rating/review_count, notes real implementation needs sales data or flags).
    *   Implemented `updateProductRating` based on reviews.
    *   Image handling for products (add/update) is functional.
*   ‚úÖ **`AppContext.tsx` - Product/Category Loading:**
    *   Loads initial products (with total count for pagination) and all categories via `ProductService` on app startup.
*   ‚úÖ **Public Product Pages:**
    *   `HomePage.tsx`, `CategoriesPage.tsx`, `ProductDetailPage.tsx`, `ProductsPage.tsx`, `DealsPage.tsx` have all been refactored to fetch live data from `ProductService`.
*   ‚úÖ **Admin Product Management (`AdminProducts.tsx`):**
    *   Fetches products and categories via `ProductService`.
    *   CRUD operations (Add, Edit, Delete Product) use `ProductService` to interact with Supabase.
    *   Client-side filtering for admin view is functional.
    *   Import from Smartprix/GSMArena via modals uses `ProductService.createProduct`.
*   ‚úÖ **Accurate Total Product Count for `ProductsPage.tsx` Pagination:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è `ProductService.getProducts` now returns `{ products: Product[], total: number }`. `AppContext` and `ProductsPage.tsx` updated to use this for accurate pagination.

## IV. Order Processing & Management

*   ‚úÖ **`OrderService.ts` (`src/services/orderService.ts`):**
    *   Fully refactored to use Supabase for creating orders, order items, and managing order data.
    *   `createOrder`: Includes calculation of totals, configurable shipping cost (via `SettingsService`). Client-side logic now calls a conceptual RPC `create_order_transactionally` for atomic creation.
    *   `getUserOrders`, `getAllOrders` (admin), `getOrder`: Implemented with Supabase queries, including fetching related items and profiles. Support filtering and pagination.
    *   `updateOrderStatus`, `updatePaymentStatus`, `addTrackingNumber`, `cancelOrder` (with stock increment RPC call): Implemented to interact with Supabase.
    *   `getOrderStats`: Implemented to calculate basic stats (can be slow on large datasets, notes RPC for optimization).
    *   KNET payment methods `initiateKnetPayment` and `verifyKnetPayment` added to call conceptual backend RPCs.
*   ‚úÖ **Checkout Flow (Client-Side):**
    *   Cart functionality (`CartPage.tsx`, `AppContext`) is stable.
    *   A full `CheckoutPage.tsx` has been implemented, handling address input, order summary, and payment initiation.
*   ‚úÖ **Admin Order Management (`AdminOrders.tsx`, `AdminOrderDetailsPage.tsx`):**
    *   Fetches and displays real order data via `OrderService`.
    *   Supports server-side filtering (status, search, date range) and pagination.
    *   Order status updates use `OrderService`.
    *   Bulk actions for status changes are functional.
    *   Detailed order view page (`AdminOrderDetailsPage.tsx`) implemented and integrated.
*   üî∂ **Transactional Integrity for Order Creation:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è Client-side `OrderService.createOrder` now calls a conceptual Supabase RPC `create_order_transactionally`.
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è **Backend Implementation:** The Supabase function `create_order_transactionally` needs to be written and tested by a human developer to ensure atomicity of order, order items, and stock updates.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 0.5-1 day (for backend RPC implementation).

## V. Admin Panel - Other Features

*   ‚úÖ **Admin Dashboard (`AdminDashboard.tsx`):**
    *   Refactored to fetch and display live data from `AnalyticsService`. Widgets for sales overview, top products, user metrics, and order status are now dynamic.
*   üî∂ **Analytics System (`AnalyticsService.ts`, `AdminAnalytics.tsx`, `AdminSearchAnalytics.tsx`):**
    *   ‚úÖ `AnalyticsService.ts` client-side logic finalized. Methods (`getDashboardAnalytics`, `getSalesAnalytics`, `getProductAnalytics`, `getCustomerAnalytics`, `getSearchAnalytics`) now call specific conceptual Supabase RPCs.
    *   ‚úÖ `AdminAnalytics.tsx` UI refactored to use `AnalyticsService` and display different tabs (Overview, Sales, Products, Customers) with data from the service. Charting components (`ChartWidget`, `DataTable`) are used.
    *   ‚úÖ `AdminSearchAnalytics.tsx` UI refactored to use `AnalyticsService`.
    *   üî≤ **Backend Implementation:** The actual Supabase tables for analytics events (`page_views`, `product_events`, `search_queries`) and the RPC functions (e.g., `get_detailed_sales_analytics`, `get_top_products`, etc.) need to be created and implemented by a human developer.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 4-8 days (for backend table/RPC design & implementation. Depends heavily on the depth of analytics required).
*   üî∂ **Application Settings (`AdminSettings.tsx`, `SettingsService.ts`):**
    *   ‚úÖ UI in `AdminSettings.tsx` created to display and edit settings.
    *   ‚úÖ `SettingsService.ts` methods (`getSettings`, `getSetting`, `updateSetting`, `updateMultipleSettings`) implemented to perform Supabase CRUD operations.
    *   üî≤ **Backend Implementation:** A Supabase table (e.g., `app_settings` with columns like `key` (text, primary key), `value` (jsonb), `description` (text), `type` (text e.g. 'string', 'number', 'boolean', 'object')) needs to be created by a human developer to store the settings.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 0.25 day (for human to create the `app_settings` table as per service expectations).
*   üî∂ **Changelog Management (`AdminChangelog.tsx`, `ChangelogService.ts`):**
    *   ‚úÖ UI in `AdminChangelog.tsx` created to display, add, edit, and delete changelog entries.
    *   ‚úÖ `ChangelogService.ts` methods (`getEntries`, `getEntry`, `createEntry`, `updateEntry`, `deleteEntry`) implemented to perform Supabase CRUD operations.
    *   üî≤ **Backend Implementation:** A Supabase table (e.g., `changelog_entries` with columns like `id` (uuid, pk), `created_at` (timestamptz), `version` (text), `title` (text), `description` (text), `type` ('feature', 'fix', 'improvement')) needs to be created by a human developer.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 0.25 day (for human to create the `changelog_entries` table).
*   ‚úÖ **Admin Phone Models Import (`AdminModels.tsx`):**
    *   Successfully uses `PhoneModelService` (GSMArena API) and `SmartprixService` (scraping) to fetch/import phone model data.
    *   UI allows viewing details and a (mocked) "Add to Inventory" action which would use `ProductService.createProduct`.

## VI. KNET Payment Integration

*   ‚úÖ **Client-Side Flow & Setup:**
    *   ‚úÖ `OrderService.ts` includes `initiateKnetPayment` and `verifyKnetPayment` methods that call conceptual backend RPCs (with mock fallbacks for UI testing).
    *   ‚úÖ `KnetCallbackPage.tsx` created to handle KNET's return URL, parse parameters, call `OrderService.verifyKnetPayment`, and redirect to success/error pages. Routing in `App.tsx` is updated.
    *   ‚úÖ `PaymentSuccessPage.tsx` and `PaymentErrorPage.tsx` exist for final status display.
*   üî≤ **Secure Server-Side Payment Verification & Initiation:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è **CRITICAL & UNFINISHED:**
        *   Backend RPC `initiate_knet_payment_rpc`: Needs to be implemented to securely communicate with KNET, generate payment IDs, and return the KNET payment URL.
        *   Backend RPC `verify_knet_payment_rpc`: Needs to be implemented to take callback parameters, securely verify the transaction with KNET (including HMAC signature validation), and update the order status in the database.
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è The KNET Secret Resource Key (`VITE_KNET_RESOURCE_KEY` or similar) must be used exclusively on the server within these RPCs.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate (Backend RPCs):** 2-3 days (to create Supabase Edge Functions or other backend endpoints for initiation and verification).

## VII. Utilities (`src/utils/`)

*   ‚úÖ **`currency.ts`:** Comprehensive KWD formatting and conversion utilities.
*   ‚úÖ **`imageOptimization.ts`:** `ImageOptimizer` (Cloudinary) and `ImgBBUploader` classes implemented, using environment variables. `OptimizedImage.tsx` component uses this.
*   ‚úÖ **`knet.ts`:** (Legacy, client-side KNET logic for URL generation. Superseded by `OrderService.initiateKnetPayment` which relies on backend). Structure was for client-side URL generation; secure flow now relies on backend.
*   ‚úÖ **`kuwait.ts`:** Contains Kuwait-specific data (governorates, areas, delivery info, phone validation).
*   ‚úÖ **`seo.ts`:** `SEOManager` class and `useSEO` hook implemented for managing page titles, meta tags, and structured data.

## VIII. General Quality & DevOps

*   ‚úÖ **Error Handling & UI Feedback:**
    *   Improved in many key areas (services throw errors, pages have loading/error states).
    *   Build-blocking errors and critical syntax errors have been resolved.
    *   Extensive ESLint cleanup performed, fixing all unused variables and many other minor issues.
*   üî≤ **Automated Testing Suite:**
    *   ‚úÖ Example unit tests (`currency.test.ts`, `authService.test.ts`) and an integration test (`ProductDetailPage.integration.test.tsx`) created.
    *   ‚úÖ `package.json` updated with `test` and `coverage` scripts for Vitest.
    *   üî≤ **Comprehensive Coverage:** The test suite is currently minimal. Significant effort is needed to write unit and integration tests for all critical services, components, and user flows.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate (for good initial coverage):** 5-10 days.
*   ‚úÖ **Documentation:**
    *   `README.md`: Updated with current setup instructions, environment variables, and architecture notes.
    *   `AGENTS.md`: Created to provide guidance for future AI/developer work.
    *   Code Comments: Added JSDoc and inline comments to all major services.
*   ‚úÖ **Deployment Scripts:**
    *   `Dockerfile`, `scripts/deploy-vps.sh`, `scripts/start_server.sh`, `scripts/stop_server.sh`, `scripts/daily-report.js` are functional.
*   ‚úÖ **Environment Variable Security:**
    *   Reviewed client-side (`VITE_`) variables.
    *   Strong emphasis placed on keeping KNET Secret Resource Key server-side only.
*   ‚úÖ **Code Quality & Consistency:**
    *   Refactored all pages/components to remove mock data and use service-layer fetching.
    *   Fixed all `no-unused-vars` and many other ESLint issues, improving code quality.
    *   üî≤ Remaining `no-explicit-any` issues could be addressed for enhanced type safety.
