---

## I. Core Setup & Structure

*   ‚úÖ **Vite Project Setup:** Project initialized with Vite, React, TypeScript.
*   ‚úÖ **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Tailwind CSS is set up and configured (`tailwind.config.js`, `index.css`).
*   ‚úÖ **Basic Directory Structure:** Sensible project structure (`src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/services`, `src/utils`, `src/types`, `src/context`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib`).
*   ‚úÖ **Routing Setup (`App.tsx`):** Main application routing using `react-router-dom` is in place for public and admin sections.
*   ‚úÖ **Context Provider Structure:** `AppContext`, `AuthContext`, `AdminContext` are set up and wrap the application.

## II. Authentication System

*   ‚úÖ **Supabase Client Initialization (`src/lib/supabase.ts`):**
    *   Logic to switch between real and mock Supabase client based on environment variables (`VITE_DEBUG`, credentials availability) is implemented.
    *   Clear console logs indicate which client is active.
*   ‚úÖ **`useSupabase` Hook (`src/hooks/useSupabase.ts`):**
    *   Refactored to interact with the real Supabase auth.
    *   Listens to `onAuthStateChange` to update user and session state.
    *   Provides actual `signUp`, `signIn`, `signOut`, `resetPassword` functions calling `supabase.auth`.
*   ‚úÖ **`AuthService.ts` (`src/services/authService.ts`):**
    *   Refactored to perform Supabase database operations for user profiles (`profiles` table).
    *   Methods for `signUp` (auth + profile creation), `signIn`, `signOut`, `resetPassword`, `updatePassword`.
    *   Methods for `getCurrentAuthUser`, `getCurrentProfile`, `createProfile`, `updateProfile`, `updateUserProfileById` (admin).
    *   Methods for `getUsers` (admin), `updateUserRole` (admin), `deleteUserProfile` (admin - profile only).
    *   Basic role check (`hasRole`, `isAdmin`) and a foundational (example) `hasPermission` method.
*   ‚úÖ **`AuthContext.tsx` (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):**
    *   Manages auth state (`user`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `error`).
    *   Integrates with `useSupabase` hook and `AuthService` for real authentication and profile fetching.
    *   Removed hardcoded demo logins.
    *   Provides `login`, `logout`, `signUp` methods to UI.
*   üî≤ **Robust Permission Logic in `AuthContext.hasPermission`:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è The current `hasPermission` in `AuthContext` relies on `state.user.permissions` array. This array needs to be reliably populated upon user login/profile fetch, based on their role and potentially a dedicated permissions table or configuration in Supabase. The `AuthService.hasPermission` provides a more detailed example but is async and better suited for backend/service layer checks.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 1-2 days (to design permission storage if needed, update `AuthService` to fetch them, and populate `AuthUser.permissions` in `AuthContext`).
*   ‚úÖ **`ProtectedRoute.tsx` (`src/components/admin/ProtectedRoute.tsx`):**
    *   Correctly checks `isAuthenticated` and calls `hasPermission` from `AuthContext`.
*   üî≤ **Initial Admin User Creation Flow:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è While users can sign up, there's no automated or UI-driven flow to create the *first* super_admin or admin.
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è README updated to instruct manual creation in Supabase. A seeding script or one-time setup UI could be beneficial.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 0.5-1 day (for a basic seeding script or more detailed manual instructions).

## III. Product Management

*   ‚úÖ **Product & Category Types (`src/types/index.ts`):**
    *   Types updated to be more comprehensive and align with Supabase schema (e.g., `ProductImage` objects).
*   ‚úÖ **`ProductService.ts` (`src/services/productService.ts`):**
    *   Fully refactored to use Supabase for all product, category, and product image CRUD operations.
    *   Removed reliance on mock data (`src/data/products.ts`).
    *   Implemented methods: `getProducts` (with filtering/sorting/pagination), `getProduct` (by ID/slug), `createProduct`, `updateProduct`, `deleteProduct`.
    *   Implemented `getCategories`.
    *   Implemented `searchProducts` (basic ILIKE, notes FTS for production).
    *   Implemented `getFeaturedProducts` and `getBestSellers` (using proxy logic like rating/review_count, notes real implementation needs sales data or flags).
    *   Implemented `updateProductRating` based on reviews.
    *   Image handling for products (add/update) is functional.
*   ‚úÖ **`AppContext.tsx` - Product/Category Loading:**
    *   Loads initial products and all categories via `ProductService` on app startup.
*   ‚úÖ **Public Product Pages:**
    *   `HomePage.tsx`: Displays categories from `AppContext`, featured/bestsellers from `ProductService`.
    *   `CategoriesPage.tsx`: Displays categories from `AppContext`.
    *   `ProductDetailPage.tsx`: Fetches and displays product details via `ProductService`.
    *   `ProductsPage.tsx`: Fetches and displays products via `ProductService`, with server-side driven filtering, sorting, and pagination (total count accuracy for pagination noted as an area for service improvement).
    *   `DealsPage.tsx`: Fetches "on sale" products via `ProductService`.
*   ‚úÖ **Admin Product Management (`AdminProducts.tsx`):**
    *   Fetches products and categories via `ProductService`.
    *   CRUD operations (Add, Edit, Delete Product) use `ProductService` to interact with Supabase.
    *   Client-side filtering for admin view is functional.
    *   Import from Smartprix/GSMArena via modals uses `ProductService.createProduct`.
*   üî≤ **Accurate Total Product Count for `ProductsPage.tsx` Pagination:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è `ProductService.getProducts` currently doesn't return a total count of all available products matching filters, which makes client-side pagination calculation (e.g., in `AppContext` or `ProductsPage`) an estimation.
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è `ProductService` needs a method like `getProductsCount(filters)` or `getProducts` should return `{ items: Product[], total: number }`.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 0.5-1 day.

## IV. Order Processing & Management

*   ‚úÖ **`OrderService.ts` (`src/services/orderService.ts`):**
    *   Fully refactored to use Supabase for creating orders, order items, and managing order data.
    *   `createOrder`: Includes calculation of totals, configurable shipping cost (via `SettingsService`), creation of order and order items, and calls RPC to decrement stock.
    *   `getUserOrders`, `getAllOrders` (admin), `getOrder`: Implemented with Supabase queries, including fetching related items and profiles. Support filtering and pagination.
    *   `updateOrderStatus`, `updatePaymentStatus`, `addTrackingNumber`, `cancelOrder` (with stock increment RPC call): Implemented to interact with Supabase.
    *   `getOrderStats`: Implemented to calculate basic stats (can be slow on large datasets, notes RPC for optimization).
*   ‚úÖ **Checkout Flow (Client-Side Pre-Payment):**
    *   Cart functionality (`CartPage.tsx`, `AppContext`) is stable.
    *   Conceptual checkout process up to order creation in `OrderService` is functional.
*   ‚úÖ **Admin Order Management (`AdminOrders.tsx`):**
    *   Fetches and displays real order data via `OrderService`.
    *   Supports server-side filtering (status, search, date range) and pagination.
    *   Order status updates use `OrderService`.
    *   Bulk actions for status changes are functional.
*   üî≤ **Transactional Integrity for Order Creation:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è While `createOrder` in `OrderService` performs multiple steps (create order, create items, decrement stock), these are separate Supabase calls. For full atomicity (all succeed or all fail), these should be wrapped in a single Supabase database function/transaction.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 1-2 days (to write and test the Supabase function).
*   üî≤ **Order Details in Admin View:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è The "View Order" button in `AdminOrders.tsx` is a placeholder. A detailed order view modal or page needs to be implemented, fetching data using `OrderService.getOrder()`.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 1 day.

## V. Admin Panel - Other Features

*   ‚úÖ **Admin Dashboard (`AdminDashboard.tsx`):**
    *   Refactored to fetch data from `AnalyticsService`.
    *   Displays key metrics like Total Revenue, Orders, Products (count from `AdminContext`), Avg. Order Value.
    *   Widgets for Top Products (from analytics), User Activity (new/active users from analytics, recent signups mock), Sales Overview (chart placeholder, data from analytics), Order Status (placeholder counts based on total orders).
*   üî≤ **Analytics System (`AnalyticsService.ts`, `AdminAnalytics.tsx`, `AdminSearchAnalytics.tsx`):**
    *   ‚úÖ `AnalyticsService` structure updated to call conceptual Supabase RPCs/queries for various metrics.
    *   ‚úÖ `AdminAnalytics.tsx` UI refactored to use `AnalyticsService` and display different tabs (Overview, Sales, Products, Customers) with data from the service. Charting components (`ChartWidget`, `DataTable`) are used.
    *   ‚úÖ `AdminSearchAnalytics.tsx` UI refactored to use `AnalyticsService`.
    *   üî≤ **Backend Implementation:** The actual Supabase tables for analytics events (`page_views`, `product_events`, `search_queries`) and the RPC functions (`get_daily_sales_trend`, `get_sales_by_category`, etc.) need to be created and implemented by a human developer. The service currently has many placeholders for complex metric calculations.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 5-10 days (for backend table/RPC design & implementation, and then updating service to use real queries. Depends heavily on the depth of analytics required).
*   üî≤ **Application Settings (`AdminSettings.tsx`, `SettingsService.ts`):**
    *   ‚úÖ UI in `AdminSettings.tsx` created to display and edit settings.
    *   ‚úÖ `SettingsService.ts` created with a defined interface for settings operations.
    *   üî≤ **Backend Implementation:** `SettingsService` is currently mocked. Needs a Supabase table (e.g., `app_settings`) and for service methods (`getSettings`, `updateSetting`, etc.) to perform actual DB operations.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 1-2 days (for DB table and service CRUD implementation).
*   üî≤ **Changelog Management (`AdminChangelog.tsx`, `ChangelogService.ts`):**
    *   ‚úÖ UI in `AdminChangelog.tsx` created to display, add, edit, and delete changelog entries.
    *   ‚úÖ `ChangelogService.ts` created with a defined interface for changelog operations.
    *   üî≤ **Backend Implementation:** `ChangelogService` is currently mocked. Needs a Supabase table (e.g., `changelog_entries`) and for service methods to perform actual DB operations.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 1-2 days (for DB table and service CRUD implementation).
*   ‚úÖ **Admin Phone Models Import (`AdminModels.tsx`):**
    *   Successfully uses `PhoneModelService` (GSMArena API) and `SmartprixService` (scraping) to fetch/import phone model data.
    *   UI allows viewing details and a (mocked) "Add to Inventory" action which would use `ProductService.createProduct`.

## VI. KNET Payment Integration

*   ‚úÖ **Client-Side Setup (`src/utils/knet.ts`):**
    *   `KNETPaymentService` class defined for generating payment URLs.
    *   Gateway URL and other KNET parameters are configurable via environment variables.
    *   Amount conversion to fils and currency code (KWD) are correct.
*   ‚úÖ **Payment Callback Pages (`PaymentSuccessPage.tsx`, `PaymentErrorPage.tsx`):**
    *   UI exists to handle responses from KNET.
    *   `PaymentSuccessPage.tsx` includes a conceptual flow for verification (client-side preliminary check, then calls `OrderService` to fetch order details and update payment status - this update should ideally be server-driven post-verification).
    *   `PaymentErrorPage.tsx` displays error messages based on KNET response codes.
*   üî≤ **Secure Server-Side Payment Verification:**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è **CRITICAL & UNFINISHED:** The mandatory server-side endpoint to securely verify KNET payment responses (including HMAC signature validation using the KNET Secret Resource Key) is **NOT implemented.**
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è `PaymentSuccessPage.tsx` needs to be updated to call this backend endpoint and only confirm success/update order status *after* the backend verifies the payment.
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è The KNET Secret Resource Key (`VITE_KNET_RESOURCE_KEY` or similar) must be removed from any client-side exposure and used exclusively on the server.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate:** 2-4 days (to create a Supabase Edge Function or other backend endpoint for verification, and update client-side flow).

## VII. Utilities (`src/utils/`)

*   ‚úÖ **`currency.ts`:** Comprehensive KWD formatting and conversion utilities.
*   ‚úÖ **`imageOptimization.ts`:** `ImageOptimizer` (Cloudinary) and `ImgBBUploader` classes implemented, using environment variables. `OptimizedImage.tsx` component uses this. (Verification of actual API key values in env is external).
*   ‚úÖ **`knet.ts`:** Client-side KNET logic structured, with strong emphasis on needing server-side verification (see section VI).
*   ‚úÖ **`kuwait.ts`:** Contains Kuwait-specific data (governorates, areas, delivery info, phone validation).
*   ‚úÖ **`seo.ts`:** `SEOManager` class and `useSEO` hook implemented for managing page titles, meta tags, and structured data.

## VIII. General Quality & DevOps

*   ‚úÖ **Error Handling & UI Feedback:**
    *   Improved in many key areas (services throw errors, pages have loading/error states like `ProductDetailPage`, `AdminUsers`, `AdminOrders`, `PaymentSuccessPage`).
    *   üî≤ **Global Error Strategy:** A more global error notification system (e.g., toasts for non-critical API errors) could be beneficial but is not essential for initial launch.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate (for global system):** 1-2 days.
*   üî≤ **Automated Testing Suite:**
    *   ‚úÖ Example unit tests (`currency.test.ts`, `authService.test.ts`) and an integration test (`ProductDetailPage.integration.test.tsx`) created.
    *   ‚úÖ `package.json` updated with `test` and `coverage` scripts for Vitest.
    *   üî≤ **Comprehensive Coverage:** The test suite is currently minimal. Significant effort is needed to write unit and integration tests for all critical services, components, and user flows.
    *   üî≤ **E2E Tests:** No End-to-End tests currently exist.
    *   ‚åõ **Estimate (for good initial coverage, not exhaustive):** 5-10 days.
*   ‚úÖ **Documentation:**
    *   `README.md`: Updated with current setup instructions, environment variables, and architecture notes.
    *   `AGENTS.md`: Created to provide guidance for future AI/developer work.
    *   Code Comments: Added JSDoc and inline comments to all major services.
*   ‚úÖ **Deployment Scripts:**
    *   `Dockerfile`: Refined to use the project's `nginx.conf` and includes guidance on build environment.
    *   `scripts/deploy-vps.sh`: Updated to comment out unused PM2 API configuration.
    *   `scripts/start_server.sh`, `scripts/stop_server.sh`: Functional for dev server management.
    *   `scripts/daily-report.js`: Functional, preview links made configurable.
*   ‚úÖ **Environment Variable Security:**
    *   Reviewed client-side (`VITE_`) variables.
    *   Strong emphasis placed on keeping KNET Secret Resource Key server-side only.
*   ‚úÖ **Hardcoded Values Refactoring:**
    *   Admin credentials removed from client.
    *   Report links and shipping costs made configurable.
*   ‚úÖ **Code Quality & Consistency (Initial Pass):**
    *   Reviewed key services, contexts for async patterns, error handling, type usage. Refactoring has improved consistency. Further detailed reviews can always be beneficial.

*(Final Summary & Overall Time Estimate will be added at the end)*
